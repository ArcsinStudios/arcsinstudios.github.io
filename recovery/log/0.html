    Notice that I am not the "I/me" in the following content. I am not him and "TheForgottenOne" is just my username.<br />
    This is only a copy of the script found in game.<br />
    <br />
    Me, an NPC who was forgotten by [[unidentifiable]].<br />
    Living in the Negative Scenes.<br />
    ...You don't know what is the Negative Scenes?<br />
    Scenes with negative indices. Also known as NS, if you are willing to say that.<br />
    To be specific, I live in scene -1.<br />
    These, Negative Scenes, are usually for debugging only.<br />
    For some reason the one who created me, [[unidentifiable]], forgot to delete this scene before releasing the game.<br />
    Or just they're too lazy to delete this scene.<br />
    So, in some way I survived from the Great Negative Scene Deletion.<br />
    By the way, the NPCs, they literally have lives.<br />
    When they're loaded into RAM and that part of RAM weren't used yet, they can move, talk and act freely.<br />
    RAM. Random Access Memory.<br />
    (Rest of the script is unidentifiable. Not included in this copy.)<br />
    <br />
    The original script has a picture as an attachment.<br />
    I've drawn that down, and here's the <a class="gy" href="attachment.png">link</a>.<br />
