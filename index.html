            Yup, we finally changed the font into 11x11.<br />

            Huh?? Wait, so "unknown pragma 'GCC'" literally means Visual Studio can't recognise the pragma "GCC"??<br />

      <h2>(2025/07/12) Yet another...?</h2>
      <p>
        Us again.<br />
        Today's work: Chinese (Simplified) localization.<br />
        Check &gt;<a href="dialogChinese.png">here</a>&lt; for the results.<br />
        Mention: since we use an 8x8 size font, if it's not showing Latin letters, a LARGE amount of text won't be suitable for LONG time reading.<br />
        If you're trying to display characters with complicated structure, such as characters in CJK Unified Ideographs:<br />
        It is suggested to show a small (or at least, not too large) amount of text or design the text to be short enough to be read in 4-5 seconds.
      </p>
      <h2>(2025/07/10) Yes, we're back</h2>

        Of course we worked on our game during the past three weeks. And we were trying not to play Bedwars.<br />
        Have a quick look at what's going on:<br />

        <span class="gradient-text1">Game Demo</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our first game made by pure C++, <em>Moonday (Demo)</em>, will be releasing this summer.<br />
        Actually, maybe. In late July, early August or something like that.<br />
        ----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
        Extra:<br />
        Another game made by Scratch, <em>Geometry Warrior</em>, will also be released.<br />
        There will be two editions: one in .sb3, one in .exe.<br />
        ----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
        Whatever, just wait for our good news!
