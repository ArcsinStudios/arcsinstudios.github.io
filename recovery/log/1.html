    Thank you so much for taking part in this ARG.<br />
    To be honest, I have never, never thought that anyone is going to find this ARG and completely solve it.<br />
    If you are still sane, you can stop reading here. All the above was the only thing I wanted to say.

        You decided to read more, didn't you?<br />
        ...<br />
        Well then.<br />
        I shall say that you loved solving riddles.<br />
        So, what about another riddle?<br />

        I think it's enough.<br />
        I don't know whether I will make another ARG or not.<br />
        I don't know if this ARG can make others laugh and think.<br />
        I don't know.<br />
        The only thing I know is,<br />
        your participation and cooperation means all this is meaningful,<br />
        not nonsense.<br />
