      <h2>(2025/06/17) Some words about our <span class="gradient-text0">Game Demo</span></h2>
      <p>
        Our first game made by pure C++, <em>Moonday (Demo)</em>, will be releasing this summer.<br>
        Actually, maybe. In late July, early August or something like that.<br>
        <hr>
        Extra:<br>
        Another game made by Scratch, <em>Geometry Warrior</em>, will also be released.<br>
        There will be two editions: one in .sb3, one in .exe.<br>
        <hr>
        Whatever, just wait for our good news!
      </p>
      <h2>(2025/07/20) International Moon Day, what did we do?</h2>
      <p>
        A: We released <em>Moonday (Demo)</em>...<br>
        ...'s demo.<br>
        What shall we call it?<br>
        <em>Moonday (Demo) (Demo)</em>?<br>
        Or<br>
        Moonday Beta 0.2.0 (Release_EN, Local Windows Debugger, Preprocessor Definitions: NDEBUG; _CONSOLE; LANG_EN; %(PreprocessorDefinitions))<br>
        ?<br>
        Uh, Maybe <a href="Moonday_0.2.0_EN.zip"><em>Moonday Beta 0.2.0</em></a>.
      </p>
      <h2>(2025/07/10) Yes, we're back</h2>
      <p>
        Of course we worked on our game during the past three weeks. And we were trying not to play Bedwars.<br>

      <h2>(2025/12/31) Our last post... in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        Guess what? Lo and behold, today is the <b class="gradient-text0">LAST</b> day of 2025!<br>
        Yes, the <b class="gradient-text0">LAST</b> day!!<br>
        <b class="gradient-text1">HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</b> (in advance, though)<br>
        <a href="renderer/">New Year Gift</a>
      </p>
      <h2>(2026/01/01) Let's chat!</h2>
      <p style="margin:20px; text-align:left;">
        Happy New Year everyone! It's January 1st! And in case I don't see you, good morning, good afternoon, and good night!<br>
        Well actually, we don't know what to write. So let's just talk about something random. This blog will be a little bit long, so we aligned the text to the left.<br>
        Have you ever noticed that the copyright notice below? Yes, it has updated from 2024-2025 to 2024-2026, automatically.<br>
        Thanks to the massive code refactor a few weeks ago (related blog: 2025/12/21 "Woah"), it makes things like this possible.<br>
        Then let's talk more about this refactor. We rewrote code, encapsulated core logic, fixed bugs, etc... Presenting to you is a (maybe) better UX.<br>
        After that, about the "experimental" page. Though it is experimental, there are still some creative or somehow odd projects.<br>
        For example, we have a little program that encodes text into binary (maybe with some custom replacements), and also decodes back (related blog: 2025/07/31 "Not news about Moonday"); there's also a 3D renderer that renders wireframes.<br>
        The best one we think is <a href="voidium/"><em>Voidium</em></a> (related blog: 2025/12/20 "Coming to town"). It is planned to be our third game. Inspired by <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank"><em>Cookie Clicker</em></a> (your games are great, Orteil!), we first wanted to make an incremental game.<br>
        But sadly, we've found that to make incremental games interesting is actually harder than we thought. So we just made it a factory game. With a bit spirit of incremental games, also with a bit that of text adventure games (this part hasn't been implemented yet).<br>
        Since we're talking about games, let's move forward to <em>Moonday</em> and <em>Geometry Warrior</em>.<br>
        <em>Moonday</em> will, of course, keep updating and providing free download (before the official release). The situation of <em>Geometry Warrior</em> is much more awkward: we ran out of inspiration. We don't know how to handle it. Maybe waiting is the best choice...<br>
        Ah, so much for a blog. We haven't wrote blogs like this for a long time. For a long time we have been writing meaningless blogs. They're just for entertainment. And today, we can finally slow down to talk about what we really wanted to talk.<br>
        To be honest, writing that kind of articles is what news editors do. They do that because they are afraid of losing their jobs, but we are programmers! ...We already lost our jobs so we aren't afraid of losing jobs! lol
